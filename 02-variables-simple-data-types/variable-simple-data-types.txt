- It should be short but descriptive


Avoiding Name Errors
--------------------
- A NameError is an error returned by a Traceback that occurs when:
    - Forgetting to set a variable's value before using it
    - A typographical error in referencing a variable name
        - A mismatch between the declared variable name & the name used to reference it

- A Traceback is triggered when a program can NOT run successfully
    - It is a record where the Python interpreter ran into trouble
        - When trying to execute the Python code
