Variables & Simple Data Types
-----------------------------

Variable
--------
- A placeholder connected to a certain value
- A label that a value can be assigned to

Naming and Using Variables
--------------------------
- ONLY contains letters, numbers and underscore
- Starts with a letter or underscore BUT NOT a number
- Spaces between words are NOT ALLOWED
    - An underscore can be used to separate words

- Avoid using Python keywords and/or function names
- A variable name should be SHORT but DESCRIPTIVE


Avoiding Name Errors
--------------------
- NameError is an error returns by a Traceback that occurs when:
    - Forgetting to set a variable's initial value before using it

    - A typographical error in referencing a variable name
        - Mismatch between declared variable name & the name used for referencing it

    - NOTE: Traceback is triggered when a program can NOT RUN successfully
        - A record where the Python interpreter ran into trouble when executing the code
