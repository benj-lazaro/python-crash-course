Variables & Simple Data Types
-----------------------------
- A variable is a placeholder connected to a certain value
    - A label that a value can be assigned to


Syntax:

<variable_name> = <value>

Example:

first_number = 10
print(first_number) # returns 10


- Naming and using variables
    - It can ONLY contain letters, numbers & underscore
    - It starts with a letter or underscore character but NOT a number
    - Whitespace between words are NOT allowed
        - Use an underscore character to separate words

    - Avoid using Python keywords and/or function names
    - It should be short BUT descriptive


- To avoid name errors
    - The "NameError" is an error returned by a Traceback, get triggered when
        - Forgetting to set an initial variable to a variable BEFORE using it

        - A typographical error when referencing a variable name
            - Mismatch between a declared variable name & the variable name used in referencing it

    - NOTE: A traceback is triggered when a program can NOT run successfully
        - A record is where the Python interpreter ran into trouble when executing the code
